Dataset information
===================

In ``ttl2html``, you can include details about the entire dataset (e.g., title, author, release date, data size) in RDF format and input it into this tool. The tool then displays this information on the main and about pages, providing a clear overview for users who are about to utilize the dataset.

The dataset metadata expected by this tool is structured as described below. Metadata about the dataset consists of three main parts: overall dataset metadata, contact information, and version history information. The model diagram illustrating the basic data structure is shown below:

The following table lists the metadata vocabularies and their namespaces used in the data model diagram above and throughout the following descriptions:

   `PROV-O (PROV ontology) <https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/>`_, prov:, http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#


The resource labeled "Entire Dataset" in the model structure above represents the overall dataset. This resource has metadata about the dataset as properties.

A resource linked to this "Entire Dataset" resource using the `dct:publisher` property represents the person or organization responsible for providing the dataset. This information is displayed as "contact" information in the Linked Data output generated by this tool.

Additionally, resources linked from the "Entire Dataset" resource using the `pav:hasCurrentVersion` property represent the "latest release version" of the dataset and provide details on the individual Linked Data datasets available. Similarly, resources linked using the `pav:hasVersion` property represent "historical information" on previous dataset versions.

Metadata for the Entire Dataset
-------------------------------

You can describe metadata for the overall dataset using the following properties:


.. csv-table:: Properties for Entire Dataset Metadata
   :header: Property, Description, Notes
   :widths: auto

   ``rdf:type``, void:Dataset
   ``dct:title``, Title of the dataset
   ``dct:description``, Description of the dataset
   ``dct:license``, Dataset license; if possible, use a URI such as a Creative Commons license
   ``foaf:homepage``, URI of the published dataset site
   ``foaf:page``, Additional page for the dataset (if it has a different URI from above)
   ``dct:publisher``, Dataset publisher (see contact information below)


Contact Information
-------------------

You can use the following properties to describe the provider. Suppose the provider is made up of multiple people. In that case, the resource representing the overall contact information is represented as a resource of the ``foaf:Project`` class, and the information of each member is linked from that resource with the ``foaf:member`` property.

.. csv-table:: Properties that represent contact information for the entire dataset (for projects and multiple people)
   :header: Properties, description, notes
   :widths: auto

   ``rdf:type``,foaf:Project
   ``foaf:name``,Name of the project
   ``foaf:member``,Member of the project (multiple repetitions possible). Links to resources that represent individuals below.

.. csv-table:: Properties that represent contact information for a dataset (for individuals and member members)
   :header: Properties, description, notes
   :widths: auto

   ``rdf:type``,foaf:Person
   ``foaf:name``,Name of the individual
   ``foaf:mbox``,Email address of the individual
   ``vcard:organization-name``,Name of the organization to which the individual belongs


Version History Information
---------------------------

Version history information provides details on the revisions of the dataset over time.

This information is managed using the `PAV (Provenance Authoring and Versioning ontology) <https://pav-ontology.github.io/pav/>`_ vocabulary.

The resource representing the latest version is linked from the "Entire Dataset" resource using the ``pav:hasCurrentVersion`` property. Version resources are linked using the ``pav:hasVersion`` properties. The following properties can be used to describe metadata for each version resource:

.. csv-table:: Properties for Version History Information
   :header: Property, Description, Notes
   :widths: auto

   ``rdf:type``, prov:Revision
   ``dct:title``, Name of the version information
   ``pav:version``, Version number
   ``dcat:bytesize``, Byte size of the dataset file
   ``void:triples``, Number of triples in the dataset file
   ``void:dataDump``, URI of the dataset file
   ``prov:qualifiedRevision``, Resource representing revision history details (can be a blank node)

For the content of revision history information, you can use the following properties:

.. csv-table:: Properties for Revision History Content
   :header: Property, Description, Notes
   :widths: auto

   ``rdf:type``, prov:Revision
   ``rdfs:comment``, Description text explaining the revision history
   ``rdfs:seeAlso``, URI with more details on the revision history (if available)
